# The World's Oldest Businesses

In this project, I explored data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses: when were they founded and which industries they belong to. The data is contained in several different datasets. In order to understand the world's oldest businesses, I needed to use joining techniques to merge our data. From there, I used manipulation tools such as grouping and filtering to answer questions about these historic businesses.
